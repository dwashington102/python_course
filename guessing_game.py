''' Guessing Game (Guess the Number)
Generate a random number between 1 and 21 (including 1 and 21).
Provide instructions to the user, and then ask the user to guess the number.
Tell the user whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.
Keeps the game going until the user guesses correctly or types “exit”.
Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken.   When the game ends,
congratulate the user and tell the user how many guesses where used to win.
'''

# Additional functionality:
# 1) Let the user select the maximum number for the range in the game.
# 2) Ask if the user wants to play again,
#    and print the average number of guesses used for all game rounds
