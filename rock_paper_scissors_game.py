'''Make a two player Rock-Paper-Scissors game.  Ask for the players’
names. On each play, have the players enter their move choice (rock,
paper, or scissors). Then compare the moves, and print out the
players’ moves, a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask
if the players want to play again.

Keep a running total of the wins/losses for each player, and when the
players end the game, print out the final wins / losses results for
the players.

Remember the game rules:
- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beats paper
- Paper beats rock
